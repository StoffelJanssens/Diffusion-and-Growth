The python file contains the software implementation of the simulation strategy.
The implementation is for scaled quantities. Here, $\sigma_\omega$ is used, and not $\acute{\sigma}_\omega$.
The software generates:
- A numpy file with the nodes that represent the profile after growth ($g = g_e$).
- A plot of the profile at several values of $g$.

Simulation parameters can be set between comments
