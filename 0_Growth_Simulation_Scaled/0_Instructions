The file 1_Growth_Simulations.py contains the software implementation of the simulation strategy delineated in the article.
The implementation is for scaled quantities. Here, $\sigma_\omega$ is used, and not $\acute{\sigma}_\omega$.
The software generates:
- A NumPy file with the nodes that represent the profile after growth ($g = g_e$).
- A plot of the profile at several values of $g$.
