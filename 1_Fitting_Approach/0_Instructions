File 1_Gen_Giv_Profs.py contains the software implementation of the simulation strategy delineated in the associated article.
The implementation is for quantities that are not scaled.
IMPORTANT: $\acute{\sigma}_\omega$ is used instead of $\sigma_\omega$
The software generates:
- A NumPy file with the nodes that represent a flat profile before growth ($g_\alpha = g_e$).
- A NumPy file with the nodes that represent the profile after growth ($g_\alpha = g_e$).

These NumPy files serve as inputs (given profiles) for 2_Fitting_Approach.py.
The latter software fits simulated profiles to the given profiles starting from initial guesses.
A plot of the fitted profile and the given profiles is generated.
The values of the fitted parameters are displayed on the command-line interface.

In both Python files, parameters can be set between comments.
